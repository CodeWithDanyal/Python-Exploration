# ðŸš€ Learning in Public: Chapter 02 - Strings in Python

Welcome to my **Learning in Public** journey! ðŸŽ‰ In this chapter, Iâ€™m diving into **Strings** in Python, and Iâ€™m excited to share everything I learn with you. Iâ€™ll be covering the basics, key concepts, and essential string operations to help you better understand Python strings.

Feel free to follow along, and check out the practice questions repo for hands-on exercises!

## ðŸŒŸ Key Concepts of Strings

### ðŸ“š What is a String?

A **String** is a sequence of characters in Python. Strings are one of the most essential data types, and understanding how to manipulate them is crucial for any Python developer. Here's the fun part: Strings in Python are **immutable**. Once created, you can't change them directly, but don't worry! Python's string methods allow you to work with copies of strings and make all sorts of modifications.

### âœ¨ Escape Sequence Characters

Escape sequences help you add special characters in strings for formatting. They allow you to control how strings behave in your code. Here are a couple of escape sequences you might use:

- `\n` : **New line**
- `\t` : **Tab space**

These characters give you extra control over the text you display, especially when youâ€™re working with formatted output.
