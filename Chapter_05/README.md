# 🌟 Chapter 5: Mastering Loops in Python 🌟

Hello, fellow Python learners! 👋 In **Chapter 5**, I dove deep into the exciting world of **loops**. Loops allow us to repeat tasks efficiently, saving time and making our code cleaner. This chapter focused on **while loops**, **for loops**, and advanced concepts like **range**, **break**, and **continue**. Here's what I explored and practiced!

## 📝 Key Concepts

### 🔄 **While Loop**
- **Definition**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.
- **Key Components**:
  1. **Initialization**: Setting the starting point for the loop variable.
  2. **Condition**: Determines when the loop stops.
  3. **Code Block**: The actions performed in each iteration.
  4. **Updation**: Updates the loop variable to eventually meet the stopping condition.

### 🔁 **For Loop**
- **Definition**: Used for iterating over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.
- **Features**:
  - Simplifies iteration for known-length sequences.
  - Syntax: `for variable in iterable`.

### ⚙️ **Range() Function**
- Generates a sequence of numbers.
- Syntax: `range(start, stop, step)`.
- Default:
  - `start` = 0
  - `step` = 1

### 🚨 **Break & Continue**
- **Break**: Exits the loop when a specific condition is met.
- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
