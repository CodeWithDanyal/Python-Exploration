# 🌟 Chapter 6: Functions and Recursion in Python 🌟

In **Chapter 6**, I explored **functions** and **recursion** in Python. Functions help modularize code, making it reusable, and recursion allows functions to call themselves to solve problems. Let’s dive into what I’ve learned!

## 📝 Key Concepts

### 🛠️ **Functions in Python**

- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
- Functions take **parameters**, perform calculations, and return **outputs**.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  def function_name(parameters):
      # Perform task
      return output
  ```

### 🔁 **Recursion**

- Recursion occurs when a function calls itself.
- Recursion and loops are related; tasks done with loops can also be done using recursion.
- **Base Case**: The condition under which the function stops calling itself to prevent infinite recursion.
- Without a **base case**, recursion leads to **stack overflow**.

## 🛠️ Practice Activities

### 🏆 Practice 01: Calculate the Average of 3 Numbers

- **Task**: I created a function `calc_avg(a, b, c)` to calculate and return the average of three numbers.

### 🔍 Practice 02: Find the Length of a List

- **Task**: I wrote a function `list_len(x)` that returns the length of a list.

### 📄 Practice 03: Print Elements of a List in a Single Line

- **Task**: I created a function `display(x)` to print elements of a list on the same line.

### 🔢 Practice 04: Calculate Factorial Using While Loop

- **Task**: I created a function `calc_fact(num)` to calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.

### 💵 Practice 05: Convert USD to PKR

- **Task**: I wrote a function `convert_curr(currency)` to convert USD to PKR based on a fixed exchange rate.

### 🔢 Practice 06: Check if a Number is Odd or Even

- **Task**: I wrote a function `check_num(number)` to check if a number is odd or even.

### 🎲 Practice 07: Guess the Number Using Recursion

- **Task**: I created a recursive function `check_num(x)` to guess a number, repeating the prompt until the correct number is guessed.

### 🔢 Practice 08: Factorial Using Recursion

- **Task**: I created a recursive function `factorial(x)` to calculate the factorial of a number.

### 🔢 Practice 09: Sum of Digits Using Recursion

- **Task**: I created a recursive function `sum(n)` to find the sum of digits of a given number.

### 📝 Practice 10: Print All Elements in a List Using Recursion

- **Task**: I wrote a recursive function `print_list(list, idx)` to print all elements of a list.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Make sure to practice both **functions** and **recursion** with different problems to strengthen your understanding. Using recursion to solve problems that are normally solved using loops can give you deeper insight into both concepts. 🧠✨

Happy Coding! 😊
